This library provides support for TypeScript/JavaScript [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) apps to access the [Shopify Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api), by making it easier to perform the following actions:

- Creating [online](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/authentication#online-access) or [offline](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/authentication#offline-access) access tokens for the Admin API via OAuth
- Making requests to the [REST API](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference)
- Making requests to the [GraphQL API](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/graphql/reference)
- Register/process webhooks

Once your app has access to the Admin API, you can also access the [Shopify Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api) to run GraphQL queries using the `unauthenticated_*` access scopes.

This library can be used in any application that has a Node.js backend, since it doesn't rely on any specific frameworkâ€”you can include it alongside your preferred stack and only use the features that you need to build your app.

# Requirements

To follow these usage guides, you will need to:

- have a basic understanding of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- have a Shopify Partner account and development store
- _OR_ have a test store where you can create a private app
- have a private or custom app already set up in your test store or partner account
- use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), in order to create a secure tunnel to your app running on your localhost
- add the `ngrok` URL and the appropriate redirect for your OAuth callback route to your app settings
- have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed

<!-- Make sure this section is in sync with docs/README.md -->

# Getting started

You can follow our [getting started guide](docs/), which will provide instructions on how to create an app using plain Node.js code, or the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. Both examples are written in Typescript.
