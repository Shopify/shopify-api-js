# shopify.webhooks.addHandlers

Adds webhook handlers to the library registry, allowing you to register them with Shopify and process HTTP webhook requests from Shopify.

See the documentation for [the full list](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic) of accepted topics.

> **Note**: you can only register multiple handlers with the same address when the delivery method is HTTP - the library will automatically chain the requests together when handling events.
> The library will fail when trying to add duplicate paths for other delivery methods.

## Example

```ts
const shopify = shopifyApi({
  /* ... */
});

const handleWebhookRequest = async (
  topic: string,
  shop: string,
  webhookRequestBody: string,
  webhookId: string,
  apiVersion: string,
) => {
  const sessionId = shopify.session.getOfflineId({shop});

  // Fetch the session from storage and process the webhook event
};

shopify.webhooks.addHandlers({
  PRODUCTS_CREATE: [
    {
      deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
      callbackUrl: '/webhooks',
      callback: handleWebhookRequest,
    },
    {
      deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
      callbackUrl: '/webhooks',
      callback: handleWebhookRequestPart2,
    },
  ],
});
```
