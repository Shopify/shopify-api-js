# Setting up webhooks

If your app needs to keep track of specific events happening on a shop, you can use [Shopify webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/webhooks) to subscribe to those events.

To do that, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Set up your webhook handlers by calling [shopify.webhooks.addHandlers](../reference/webhooks/addHandlers.md).
1. Register your handlers with Shopify after the app is installed by calling [shopify.webhooks.register](../reference/webhooks/register.md).
1. Process incoming events by doing **ONE** of the following:
   1. setting up an endpoint that calls [shopfiy.webhooks.validate](../reference/webhooks/validate.md).
   1. setting up an endpoint that calls [shopfiy.webhooks.process](../reference/webhooks/process.md).

Below is an example of how to register webhooks after OAuth completes:

```ts
const shopify = shopifyApi({
  /* ... */
});

// Call shopify.webhooks.addHandlers here (see examples below)

const app = express();

// Register webhooks after OAuth completes
app.get('/auth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const callbackResponse = await shopify.auth.callback({
      rawRequest: req,
      rawResponse: res,
    });

    const response = await shopify.webhooks.register({
      session: callbackResponse.session,
    });

    if (!response['PRODUCTS_CREATE'][0].success) {
      console.log(
        `Failed to register PRODUCTS_CREATE webhook: ${response['PRODUCTS_CREATE'][0].result}`,
      );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error); // in practice these should be handled more gracefully
  }

  return res.redirect('/'); // or wherever you want your user to end up after OAuth completes
});
```

You can use `validate` to process your webhooks:

```ts
// Add handlers for the events you want to subscribe to. You don't need a callback if you're just using `validate`
shopify.webhooks.addHandlers({
  PRODUCTS_CREATE: [
    {deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http, callbackUrl: '/webhooks'},
  ],
});

// Handle webhooks
app.post('/webhooks', express.text({type: '*/*'}), async (req, res) => {
  const {valid, topic, domain} = await shopify.webhooks.validate({
    rawBody: req.body, // is a string
    rawRequest: req,
    rawResponse: res,
  });

  if (!valid) {
    console.error('Invalid webhook call, not handling it');
    res.send(400); // Bad Request
  }

  console.log(`Received webhook for ${topic} for shop ${domain}`);

  const sessionId = shopify.session.getOfflineId({shop: domain});

  // Run your webhook-processing code here!
});
```

**OR**, you can pass in a `callback` in your handler configuration, and call `process`:

```ts
const handleWebhookRequest = async (
  topic: string,
  shop: string,
  webhookRequestBody: string,
  webhookId: string,
  apiVersion: string,
) => {
  const sessionId = shopify.session.getOfflineId({shop});

  // Run your webhook-processing code here!
};

// Add handlers for the events you want to subscribe to. You **MUST** set a callback function when calling `process`
shopify.webhooks.addHandlers({
  PRODUCTS_CREATE: [
    {
      deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
      callbackUrl: '/webhooks',
      callback: handleWebhookRequest,
    },
  ],
});

// Process webhooks
app.post('/webhooks', express.text({type: '*/*'}), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Note: the express.text() given above is an Express middleware that will read
    // in the body as a string, and make it available at req.body, for this path only.
    await shopify.webhooks.process({
      rawBody: req.body, // is a string
      rawRequest: req,
      rawResponse: res,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
});
```

## Note regarding use of body parsers

Unlike `v5` and earlier versions of this library, `shopify.webhooks.process()` now expects to receive the body content (in string format) as a parameter and no longer reads in the request body directly.

This allows for the use of body-parsers in your code.

To use Express as an example, if you wish to use the `express.json()` middleware in your app, the webhook processing can now occur after calling `app.use(express.json())`. For any path that's a webhooks path, `express.text({type: '*/*'})` should be used so that `req.body` is a string that `shopify.webhooks.process()` expects:

```typescript
await shopify.webhooks.process({
  rawBody: req.body,
  rawRequest: req,
  rawResponse: res,
});
```
