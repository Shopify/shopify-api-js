### Minor Changes

- 1a64d96c: Added `returnUrl` as optional parameter to billing `request` function, improved `returnUrl` logic. See [documentation](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/blob/main/docs/reference/billing/request.md#returnurl) of `returnUrl` parameter for more details.

### Patch Changes

- 8de3c783: Removed `setCrypto` function to simplify runtimes
- 2628a7fc: Add scopes validation for AuthScopes object and convert it to array. Fixes [#1208](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node/issues/1208), [1221](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node/issues/1221)
- d028ec0f: Replace `semver` with `compare-versions` lib to reduce dependency on nodejs builtin-libs
- 7dcecb65: [Custom store apps only] Add new `adminApiAccessToken` parameter to `config` for when `isCustomStoreApp` is `true`. If set, it will be used for API access. `apiSecretKey` should now be set to the custom store app's API secret key, which is used to validate the HMAC of webhook events received from Shopify for a custom store app. Fixes [#772](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/issues/772), [#800](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/issues/800)

  For apps that don't receive HTTP webhook events from Shopify, no change is required yet - `apiSecretKey` will be used for client authentication as the fallback option.

  Starting with the next major release

  - `adminApiAccessToken` will be mandatory for custom store apps and must be set to the Admin API access token
  - `apiSecretKey` will not be used for client authentication but must be set for HMAC validation of HTTP webhook events

  See [setting up a custom store app](https://github.com/shopify/shopify-api-js/blob/main/docs/guides/custom-store-app.md) for more details.

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5a68e4a5: ⚠️ [Breaking] Return pagination info as part of .all() requests in REST resources, and remove the `[PREV|NEXT]_PAGE_INFO` static, thread unsafe attributes.
  Instead of returning a plain array of objects, it will now return an object containing that array, as well as the response headers and pagination info.

  This enables apps to use locally-scoped pagination info, which makes it possible to use pagination in a thread-safe way.

  You'll need to make 2 changes to use this version:

  1. Where you accessed resources from the response, you'll now access the `data` property.
  1. Where you accessed pagination data from the static variables, you'll now retrieve it from the response.

  ```ts
  const response = await shopify.rest.Product.all({
    /* ... */
  });

  // BEFORE
  const products: Product[] = response;
  const nextPageInfo = shopify.rest.Product.NEXT_PAGE_INFO;

  // AFTER
  const products: Product[] = response.data;
  const nextPageInfo = response.pageInfo?.nextPage;
  const responseHeaders = response.headers;
  ```

- fc2692f0: ⚠️ [Breaking] Removing deprecated code:

  - The `isPrivateApp` param from `shopifyApi()` was removed in favour of `isCustomStoreApp`.
  - The `isOnline` param from `shopify.auth.callback()` was removed, because it's now handled automatically.

- 8acc71da: Adding support for 2023-04 API version.

  ⚠️ [Breaking] Removing support for 2022-04 and 2022-07 API versions.

- 2096f9e4: The logger is now synchronous. This removes unnecessary `await`'s from functions that use the logger but functionally don't need to `await` anything else. `webhooks.addHandlers` is the main impacted public method (it was `async` only because of the logging mechanism).

  Apps that use the default logging methods (which send to `console`) will not be impacted by this change. Apps that implement their own loggers _may_ be impacted; async logging functions can still be used but they need to be handled as promises.

  ```ts
  // BEFORE
  const myLogFunction = async (severity, message) => {
    try {
      await MyService.log(severity, message);
      // After external call
    } catch {
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  // AFTER
  const myLogFunction = (severity, message) => {
    MyService.log(severity, message)
      .then(() => {
        // After external call
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // Handle error
      });
  };
  ```

  app.post('/graphql', async (req, res) => {
    await Shopify.Utils.graphqlProxy(req, res);
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  app.post('/graphql', async (req, res) => {
    const response = await Shopify.Utils.graphqlProxy(req, res);
    res.status(200).send(response.body);
  });
