All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

- Increased tolerance for expired JWT session tokens from 5s to 10s [#462](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/462)
- Add support for billing to the library [#449](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/449)
- Allow dynamically typing the body of REST and GraphQL request responses, so callers don't need to cast it [#447](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/447)
- Rather than create a temporary session in order to store a session id in a cookie for the OAuth transaction, we can store the `state` in the cookie instead, that can then be compared against the `state` provided by Shopify in the callback. [#438](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/438)

## [5.0.1] - 2022-08-03

- Include subset of query body in API deprecation logs [#426](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/426)

## [4.0.0] - 2022-07-04

- ⚠️ [Breaking] Add REST resources for July 2022 API version, add `LATEST_API_VERSION` constant, remove support and REST resources for July 2021 (`2021-07`) API version [#415](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/415)
- Add support for July 2022 API version [#409](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/409)

### Fixes

- Fix a bug where the PostgreSQL session storage always attempted to create the sessions table [#413](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/413)

## [3.1.3] - 2022-06-08

### Fixes

- Return instances of `Session` from session storages, not POJOs.

## [3.1.2] - 2022-06-07

### Added

- Store user id and expiration date of online tokens

### Fixes

- Properly parse a non-json HTTP response [#257](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/issues/257)
- Don’t create a SQLite DB file if the SQLite storage is not used.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-05-16

### Added

- Support for specifying the URI scheme of the host [#385](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/385)
- Add optional `saving` parameter to `serialize` of `Base` class - default is `false` and will include read-only attributes in returned object; `true` used for `save` when committing via API to Shopify.

### Fixed

- Fixes [#363](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/issues/363)
  - Webhooks `register` now checks for any attempt to register a GDPR topic (not done via API but by Partner Dashboard), provides an error message in response
  - For topics that don't exist, `register` checks the response from the initial API call for an `errors` field and returns accordingly

## [3.0.1] - 2022-04-11

### Added

- Allow REST resources to configure a deny list of attributes to be excluded when saving [#355](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/355)

## [3.0.0] - 2022-04-04

### Added

- ⚠️ [Breaking] Removing API version `2021-04` [#343](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/343)
- ⚠️ [Breaking] The `HttpResponseError` error and its flavours (all returned from HTTP requests) have been slightly altered:
  - They now take in a hash of values, and will always include the response code, body (as a string if the response is not JSON), and headers
  - All response fields are now contained within a `response` object, to make it easier to access them
- ⚠️ [Breaking] Update supported Admin API versions [#310](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/310)
- Allow full paths in REST requests [#301](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/301)

### Fixed

- ⚠️ [Breaking] Stop responding to the request in the GraphQL Proxy function, returning Shopify's response instead [#312](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-node/pull/312)

  The examples below are in [express](https://expressjs.com/); you will now need to handle the response yourself.

  Before:

  ```js
  app.post('/graphql', async (req, res) => {
    await Shopify.Utils.graphqlProxy(req, res);
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  app.post('/graphql', async (req, res) => {
    const response = await Shopify.Utils.graphqlProxy(req, res);
    res.status(200).send(response.body);
  });
  ```
