## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- 64f61414:

  > [!NOTE]
  > This change only affects apps that are using custom runtime adapters.
  > If you're using a default adapter from this package, you don't need to make this change.

  Changed `setAbstractFetchFunc` to accept a `fetch` API instead of one based on `NormalizedRequest` and `NormalizedResponse`.

  With this change, we can return a `Response` object for requests with the upcoming clients, which can help make the interface for requests more familiar to users.

  For more information and examples, see the [migration guide to v9](./docs/migrating-to-v9.md#changes-to-runtime-adapters).

- 7bd4be08: Rephrased `gdprTopics` to `privacyTopics` to account for other privacy regulations with data subject requests.

  This changes the name of the exported object.
  You can fix this by changing your `import` statements:

  Before:

  ```ts
  import { gdprTopics } from "@shopify/shopify-api";
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import { privacyTopics } from "@shopify/shopify-api";
  ```

### Minor Changes

  For more information and examples, see the [migration guide to v9](./docs/migrating-to-v9.md#using-the-new-clients).

- 18781092: Updated shopify-api GraphQL clients' APIs to be closer to the underlying clients
- 4dd7612d: Underpinned the new REST client from `admin-api-client` into `shopify-api`, so apps can access it as a standalone client as well.
- 5e85e15b: Added support for the 2024-01 API version.
- 64cda80a: Add helpers to convert between shop admin URLs and legacy URLs. `sanitizeShop` utility method can now support shop admin URLs.

### Minor Changes

- bf0664bb: Line Item Billing

  Now with the future flag `unstable_lineItemBilling` you can specify multiple line items in a single billing request. This will allow you to create a single billing request for a subscription with both recurring and usage based app billing.

  You will define the new billingConfig as follows.

  ```ts
  const shopify = shopifyApp({
    billing: {
      MultipleLineItems: {
        replacementBehavior: BillingReplacementBehavior.ApplyImmediately,
        trialDays: 7,
        lineItems: [
          {
            interval: BillingInterval.Usage,
            amount: 30,
            currencyCode: "USD",
            terms: "per 1000 emails",
          },
          {
            interval: BillingInterval.Every30Days,
            amount: 30,
            currencyCode: "USD",
            discount: {
              durationLimitInIntervals: 3,
              value: {
                amount: 10,
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    futures: {
      unstable_lineItemBilling: true,
    },
  });
  ```

- 7dcecb65: [Custom store apps only] Add new `adminApiAccessToken` parameter to `config` for when `isCustomStoreApp` is `true`. If set, it will be used for API access. `apiSecretKey` should now be set to the custom store app's API secret key, which is used to validate the HMAC of webhook events received from Shopify for a custom store app. Fixes [#772](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/issues/772), [#800](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/issues/800)

  For apps that don't receive HTTP webhook events from Shopify, no change is required yet - `apiSecretKey` will be used for client authentication as the fallback option.

  Starting with the next major release

  - `adminApiAccessToken` will be mandatory for custom store apps and must be set to the Admin API access token
  - `apiSecretKey` will not be used for client authentication but must be set for HMAC validation of HTTP webhook events

  See [setting up a custom store app](docs/guides/custom-store-app.md) for more details.

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5a68e4a5: ⚠️ [Breaking] Return pagination info as part of .all() requests in REST resources, and remove the `[PREV|NEXT]_PAGE_INFO` static, thread unsafe attributes.
  Instead of returning a plain array of objects, it will now return an object containing that array, as well as the response headers and pagination info.

  This enables apps to use locally-scoped pagination info, which makes it possible to use pagination in a thread-safe way.

  You'll need to make 2 changes to use this version:

  1. Where you accessed resources from the response, you'll now access the `data` property.
  1. Where you accessed pagination data from the static variables, you'll now retrieve it from the response.

  ```ts
  const response = await shopify.rest.Product.all({
    /* ... */
  });

  // BEFORE
  const products: Product[] = response;
  const nextPageInfo = shopify.rest.Product.NEXT_PAGE_INFO;

  // AFTER
  const products: Product[] = response.data;
  const nextPageInfo = response.pageInfo?.nextPage;
  const responseHeaders = response.headers;
  ```

- fc2692f0: ⚠️ [Breaking] Removing deprecated code:

  - The `isPrivateApp` param from `shopifyApi()` was removed in favour of `isCustomStoreApp`.
  - The `isOnline` param from `shopify.auth.callback()` was removed, because it's now handled automatically.

- 8acc71da: Adding support for 2023-04 API version.

  ⚠️ [Breaking] Removing support for 2022-04 and 2022-07 API versions.

- 2096f9e4: The logger is now synchronous. This removes unnecessary `await`'s from functions that use the logger but functionally don't need to `await` anything else. `webhooks.addHandlers` is the main impacted public method (it was `async` only because of the logging mechanism).

  Apps that use the default logging methods (which send to `console`) will not be impacted by this change. Apps that implement their own loggers _may_ be impacted; async logging functions can still be used but they need to be handled as promises.

  ```ts
  // BEFORE
  const myLogFunction = async (severity, message) => {
    try {
      await MyService.log(severity, message);
      // After external call
    } catch {
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  // AFTER
  const myLogFunction = (severity, message) => {
    MyService.log(severity, message)
      .then(() => {
        // After external call
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // Handle error
      });
  };
  ```

### Fixed

- ⚠️ [Breaking] Stop responding to the request in the GraphQL Proxy function, returning Shopify's response instead [#312](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/pull/312)

  The examples below are in [express](https://expressjs.com/); you will now need to handle the response yourself.

  Before:

  ```js
  app.post("/graphql", async (req, res) => {
    await Shopify.Utils.graphqlProxy(req, res);
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  app.post("/graphql", async (req, res) => {
    const response = await Shopify.Utils.graphqlProxy(req, res);
    res.status(200).send(response.body);
  });
  ```
